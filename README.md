Window Functions for complex calculations (RANK(), LEAD(), LAG(), moving averages).

Conditional logic with CASE, COALESCE, and NULLIF.

Core Functions:

Numeric, String, and Date functions.

Date formatting and calculations.

Database Programmability:

Core Database Concepts:

ACID properties, Transactions, and Isolation Levels.

Detailed overview of Data Types (String, Integer, JSON, etc.).

Storage Engines, including InnoDB and MyISAM.

Performance and Optimization:

Indexing strategies, including single, composite, and prefix indexes.

Using the EXPLAIN command to analyze query performance.

Security and User Management:

Creating users and managing privileges with GRANT and REVOKE.

Statistics for Data Scientists (Statistics for Data scientist.md)
This section provides a thorough overview of statistical concepts, from foundational principles to advanced modeling techniques.

The Bias-Variance Trade-off.

Algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees.

Ensemble Methods: Bagging, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).

Regularization with Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2).

Unsupervised Learning:

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

Clustering methods: K-Means, Hierarchical, and Model-Based Clustering.

Advanced Modeling & Interpretation:

Causal Inference, Survival Analysis, and specialized regression models.

Bayesian Inference, Deep Learning, Time Series Forecasting, and Model Interpretability (SHAP, LIME).

Python: Data Structures for Interviews (Arrays, Stacks, and Queues.md)
This section focuses on fundamental data structures that are common in technical interviews, with a focus on their properties, complexities, and common patterns.

Key Topics Covered:

Arrays:

Properties: O(1) random access, contiguous memory.

Complexities: Analysis of access, search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Essential Patterns:

Two Pointers: For problems like Two Sum II and removing duplicates from a sorted array.

In-place Manipulation: Techniques to modify arrays without using extra memory, such as in the Move Zeroes problem.

Sliding Window: For problems on contiguous subarrays, like finding the maximum average subarray.

Stacks (LIFO - Last-In, First-Out):

Properties & Operations: Push, Pop, Peek.

Applications: Parsing expressions (e.g., Valid Parentheses), managing recursion.

Examples: Baseball Game, Valid Parentheses, and Min Stack problems.

Queues (FIFO - First-In, First-Out):

Properties & Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue.

Applications: Breadth-First Search (BFS), task scheduling.

Examples: Implementing a queue using stacks.
