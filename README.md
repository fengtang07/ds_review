### **How to Use This Repository**

This repository is designed for quick review and preparation for data science interviews. Hereâ€™s how you can make the most of it:

1.  **Identify Your Weak Points:** Look through the topics listed below in each section. If you are unfamiliar with a topic or need a refresher, navigate to the corresponding file.
2.  **Review Core Concepts:** Each file provides a condensed and focused overview of a subject. Use them to refresh your memory on key definitions, principles, and syntax.
3.  **Practice with Examples:** The files include practical examples and solutions to common problems (e.g., LeetCode-style questions in the Python file, query examples in the SQL file). Try to solve these problems yourself before looking at the solution.
4.  **Focus on Interview-Relevant Topics**: The content is curated to cover what is commonly asked in data science interviews, from technical screenings to on-site challenges.

### **Statistics for Data Scientists (`Statisitc/Statistics for Data scientist.md`)**

This section provides a thorough overview of statistical concepts, from foundational principles to advanced modeling techniques.

* **Key Topics Covered**:
    * **Foundational Concepts**: Descriptive statistics, probability, and distributions.
    * **EDA & Sampling**: Handling missing data, CLT, and bootstrapping.
    * **Statistical Experiments**: Hypothesis testing, A/B testing, ANOVA, and Chi-Square tests.
    * **Regression & Prediction**: Linear regression, model evaluation, and non-linear models.
    * **Classification**: Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and evaluation metrics (ROC, AUC).
    * **Statistical Machine Learning**: Bias-variance trade-off, KNN, decision trees, ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost), and regularization.
    * **Unsupervised Learning**: PCA, K-Means, and hierarchical clustering.
    * **Advanced Modeling**: Causal inference, survival analysis, and model interpretability (SHAP, LIME).

### **Python: Data Structures for Interviews (`Python/Arrays, Stacks, and Queues.md`)**

This section focuses on fundamental data structures common in technical interviews, emphasizing their properties, complexities, and application patterns.

* **Key Topics Covered**:
    * **Arrays**:
        * **Properties & Complexities**: O(1) access and performance of various operations.
        * **Essential Patterns**: Two pointers, in-place manipulation, and sliding window.
    * **Stacks (LIFO)**:
        * **Properties & Operations**: Push, Pop, Peek.
        * **Applications**: Parsing expressions and managing recursion.
    * **Queues (FIFO)**:
        * **Properties & Operations**: Enqueue, Dequeue.
        * **Applications**: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and task scheduling.
